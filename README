## API Usage

### POST /chat

Send a POST request to `/chat` with a JSON body containing the user message. Example:

#### Request:
```json
{
  "message": "Why is the sky blue?"
}
```

#### Response:
```json
{
  "user_message": "Why is the sky blue?",
  "bot_response": "My circuits suggest yes. Or no. Probably."
}
```

### Example (Using Python `requests` library):
```python
import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat"
payload = {"message": "Why is the sky blue?"}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
print(response.json())
